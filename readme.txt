Goes through your posts and handles the broken images that might appear on the posts on your blog.

== Description ==

Broken Post Content Images is a Free and Open Source Wordpress plugin which is able to search for broken images within your posts and replace them with a 1x1 transparent gif. It doesn't matter if you have 1 post or 100,000 posts, it will handle it. You can control exactly which post to check by optionally specifying a post id number (or just put all to check all posts).

Benefit? Your images never become dead because you have full control!

* Log in to Wordpress Administration area, choose "Plugins" from the main menu, find "Broken Post Content Images", and click the "Activate" button
